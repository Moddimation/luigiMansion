/*
 *		Notes
 *		-----
 *
 *			What we need in certain areas of the library is the ability to "lock"
 *			certain critical regions of code against reentrance by preemptive
 *			threads. For example, when fopen searches for an unused FILE struct, it
 *			would be unfortunate if another thread "found" the same struct before the
 *			first one could mark it as in-use.
 *			
 *			Because the mechanisms used to manage critical regions will vary widely
 *			depending on the underlying hardware and/or system software, *all*
 *			details about how critical regions are locked and released are kept
 *			hidden. Instead, we define a finite number of critical regions that are
 *			of interest to us and leave the details of how they are managed invisible.
